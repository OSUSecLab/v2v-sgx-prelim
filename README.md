Overview
--------------------
This repository contain preliminary code to test the performance of V2V communication for Intel-SGX versus the PKI-Digital-Certificate-based authentication approach. Details of the experiment setup, results, and assumptions are detailed in the corresponding publication of our paper [Towards A TEE-based V2V Protocol For Connected And Autonomous Vehicles](https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~lin.3021/file/AutoSec2022.pdf).
